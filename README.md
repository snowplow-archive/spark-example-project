# Spark Example Project [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow/spark-example-project.png)](https://travis-ci.org/snowplow/spark-example-project)

## Introduction

This is a simple word count job written in Scala for the [Spark] [spark] cluster computing platform, with instructions for running on [Amazon Elastic MapReduce] [emr] in non-interactive mode. The code is ported directly from Twitter's [`WordCountJob`] [wordcount] for Scalding.

This was built by the Professional Services team at [Snowplow Analytics] [snowplow], who use Spark on their [Data pipelines and algorithms] [data-pipelines-algos] projects.

_See also:_ [Scalding Example Project] [scalding-example-project] | [Cascalog Example Project] [cascalog-example-project]

## Building

Assuming you already have [SBT] [sbt] installed:

    $ git clone git://github.com/snowplow/spark-example-project.git
    $ cd spark-example-project
    $ sbt assembly

The 'fat jar' is now available as:

    target/spark-example-project-0.3.0.jar

## Unit testing

The `assembly` command above runs the test suite - but you can also run this manually with:

    $ sbt test
    <snip>
    [info] + A WordCount job should
    [info]   + count words correctly
    [info] Passed: : Total 1, Failed 0, Errors 0, Passed 1, Skipped 0

## Running on Amazon EMR

### Prepare

Assuming you have already assembled the jarfile (see above), now upload the jar to an Amazon S3 bucket and make the file publically accessible.

Next, upload the data file [`data/hello.txt`] [hello-txt] to S3.

### Run

Finally, you are ready to run this job using the [Amazon Ruby EMR client] [emr-client]:

```
$ elastic-mapreduce --create --name "Spark Example Project" --instance-type m1.xlarge --instance-count 3 \
  --bootstrap-action s3://elasticmapreduce/samples/spark/0.8.1/install-spark-shark.sh --bootstrap-name "Install Spark/Shark" \
  --jar s3://elasticmapreduce/libs/script-runner/script-runner.jar --step-name "Run Spark Example Project" \
  --step-action TERMINATE_JOB_FLOW \
  --arg s3://snowplow-hosted-assets/common/spark/run-spark-job-0.1.0.sh \
  --arg s3://{{JAR_BUCKET}}/spark-example-project-0.2.0.jar \
  --arg com.snowplowanalytics.spark.WordCountJob \
  --arg s3n://{{IN_BUCKET}}/hello.txt \
  --arg s3n://{{OUT_BUCKET}}/results
```

Replace `{{JAR_BUCKET}}`, `{{IN_BUCKET}}` and `{{OUT_BUCKET}}` with the appropriate paths.

### Inspect

Once the output has completed, you should see a folder structure like this in your output bucket:

     results
     |
     +- _SUCCESS
     +- part-00000
     +- part-00001

Download the files and check that `part-00000` contains:

    (hello,1)
    (world,2)

while `part-00001` contains:

    (goodbye,1)

## Running on your own Spark cluster

If you have successfully run this on your own Spark cluster, we would welcome a pull-request updating the instructions in this section.

## Next steps

Fork this project and adapt it into your own custom Spark job.

To invoke/schedule your Spark job on EMR, check out:

* [Spark Plug] [spark-plug] for Scala
* [Elasticity] [elasticity] for Ruby
* [Boto] [boto] for Python
* [Lemur] [lemur] for Clojure

## Roadmap

* Bump to Spark 0.9.x when this is supported by EMR ([#1] [issue-1]).
* Change output from tuples to TSV ([#2] [issue-2])
